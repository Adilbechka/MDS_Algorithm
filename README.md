In my "Geo Machine Learning" class, we were implementing MDS algorithm that would reduce
dimensionality of a given 3D cube to 2D. In the oridinal project, cube parameters were
hardcoded and we had to generate images of the reduced cube. As an independent project,
I decided to create an app that would have interactive GUI for user to enter cube
parameters and that would render cube images inside an app window.

Screenshots of the GUI added!

To run an app, simply execute the python "mdsAlgorithm.py" script!

Note: This project has been developed using "Anaconda" Python 3.6!
If code does not execute, make sure you using "Anaconda" Python 3.6
